"""N queens solution finder module.

Usage: nqueens N:
    If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print
        Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1.
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
    If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line,
    and exit with the status 1.
    If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new
    line, and exit with the status 1.
The program should print every possible solution to the problem.
    One solution per line.
    Format: see README.
    You donâ€™t have to print the solutions in a specific order.
You are only allowed to import the sys module.
